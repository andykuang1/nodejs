Learning node.js through w3schools


### myfirst.js | demo\_module.js | demo\_url.js | demo\_query.js
In command line, run
```
node [filename]
```
to setup computer as a server, which can then be accessed on the web browser with
http://localhost:8080/

For url, we can add any url to have the server print out the accessed url
For query, we see that we can add variables through the use of '?' and variable queries like 'year=2017' An example access would be 
```
http://localhost:8080/?year=2017&month=July
```
which would print out 2017 July, since our query script prints out the year and month requested.
